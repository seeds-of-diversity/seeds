               <p>We're selecting upright-growing plants from an originally mixed population, aiming for a plant shape that is easier to harvest.</p>
               <p>Ground cherries (<i>Physalis pruinosa</i>) are small, sweet, golden-yellow berries that are relatives of tomatillos and tomatoes.
                  Each fruit is enclosed in a wrapper, and it falls from the plant when ripe, so you harvest by picking them off the ground.
                  Since low-growing branches make the berries hard to see, we're breeding for upright branches and good flavour.</p>";
